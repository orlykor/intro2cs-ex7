python3.3 ex7.py


==================
=  Description:  =
==================

in part B we did the rest of the funcs. 
first we made a list of matching points between the source or target triangles
(doesnt matter which) and the intermediate triangle (which we found, one func 
before). then we needed to get the pixels from the source and target 
images, with the use of all the 3 triangles we found. that way we make the
other intermediate image, and in the last func we made, we do a sequences of
images between the source and the target, using the funcs we made.
that way, when we have all the sequences of images, we prass the butten 
morphing and it runs the last func and from there the others.
last, we get a folder with all the new images (with the deafult num of 40)
